# QMUL-Dissertation-Ethnic-Disparities

## Title
Evaluation of under-representation of ethnic groups as a barrier to equitable advancement in breast cancer genomic research and precision medicine in the UK 

 
## AIM. 
To assess the representation of minority ethnic groups across research cohorts, large-scale initiatives, models and derived resources, and to evaluate how under-representation may hinder equitable progress in genomic research and precision medicine in the UK. 

 
## OBJECTIVES 

i.   International research initiatives. Assess inclusion of ethnic minority populations in research consortia e.g., TCGA (TCGA BRCA Projects), ICGC METABRIC   

ii.  Biobank demographics. Evaluate the ethnic composition of major biobanks (e.g., UK Biobank, Breast Cancer Now Biobank etc).   

iii. Clinical Trial Participation.  Review participant demographics in relevant clinical trials to assess minority inclusion and disparities in trial design. 

iv. Tools, Resources and Models. Examine ethnic biases in variant annotation databases and tools (e.g., SIFT, PolyPhen2, ClinVar etc.), also predictive models (OncoType DX, MammaPrint etc.), and assess implications of these. 

v. Review pharmacogenomic resources. Attempt to examine inclusivity of general and ethnicity-specific pharmacogenomic databases and tools in terms of ethnic minority populations (e.g., PharmGKB, DrugBank, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium etc). 

vi. Comparative baseline analysis. Compare these outputs using NDRS (NHSDigital) baseline.
